Hi!

I am a first year Economics PhD student at Harvard. My interests lie in the intersection of financial economics and IO. 

Before joining Harvard, I was a research fellow in finance at Stanford Graduate School of Business. During my time there, I collaborated closely with Professor Chenzi Xu on the digitization of Banking Almanacs spanning from 1850 to the 1990s.

I am French with Ukrainian origins. Every day, people are losing their lives due to the ongoing conflict. Please, consider donating via [Kyiv School of Economics](https://foundation.kse.ua/en/donation/) or other charitable organisations.
